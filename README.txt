We created a program that allows us to send messages to other users that are connected to a DSU server we did this by creating a file called DS messenger that deals with sending Json wrapped messages to the server which gives us information like users that have messaged us and also messages that have been unread this also allows us to connect with other users in the server as well. We had to use classes and also practice using tkinter. The pr0gram allows you to load a file, open a file, or change you username and password. You can add contacts or wait for users to text you first. It is a very simple program that makes talking to other users very simple
